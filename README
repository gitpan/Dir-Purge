Dir::Purge implements functions to reduce the number of files in a
directory according to a strategy. It currently provides one strategy:
removal of files by age.

EXAMPLES
========

From the command-line:

  perl -MDir::Purge -e 'purgedir (5, @ARGV)' /spare/backups

From your Perl program:

  use Dir::Purge;
  purgedir ({keep => 5, strategy => "by_age", verbose => 1}, "/spare/backups");

  use Dir::Purge qw(purgedir_by_age);
  purgedir_by_age (5, "/spare/backups");
